      Also in the mint family, the leaves of this plant can be used to flavor tea, candy and ice cream. It also can be used to repel mosquitos and in aromatherapy. Lemon balm should be avoided by anyone taking thyroid medication (thyroxine, for example), because it is thought to inhibit the absorption of the medication. This plant has been studied for its stress-reduction, antiviral and antibacterial properties. This species contains eugenol, which kills bacteria and has been known to calm muscles and numb tissues as well as terpenes that add to its soothing effects. (Wikipedia)

      This plant is a member of the pea family, and like other leguminous plants, it fixes nitrogen. It is considered poisonous although it is used medicinally for a number of ailments and was used by American Indians to treat toothaches and nausea. Cherokee Indians used this plant to make a blue dye, as did European settlers. If the stems are broken, a sap will be secreted that turns dark blue upon contact with the air. It produces deep blue, pea-like flowers. (Wikipedia)

      This Sunflower family plant is grown for its root vegetables that bear a resemblance to ginger root. It is said to have a potato-like consistency although more crisp. The tuber is often cooked by lightly steaming and has a mild, sweet and nutty flavor when prepared correctly. Jerusalem Artichoke was traditionally used by the Dakota, Shawnee and Miami American Indian tribes. The French explorer Samuel de Champlain found them being grown in Cape Cod in 1605. It was planted at Monticello and called by its French name, topinambours, by Thomas Jefferson. Helianthus tuberosa is often referred to as sunchoke. This plant’s high level of inulin*, a carbohydrate, makes it an important source of fructose for industry. “In the Baden-Wurttemburg state of Germany over ninety percent of the helianthus tuberosa grown is used to make a spirit called Topinambur, Topi or Rossler” (Wikipedia). Not digested well by some people.

      This native vine produces a root vegetable that is high in protein and has a flavor similar to potatoes. Improved varieties are being developed with larger, and less numerous tubers. Its vegetables can be found by digging up the cord-like roots and following them to find the swelled ‘beads’. Called “rosaries” by the early Canadian settlers, apios americana is another root crop that was used by American Indians.

      Though many people aren’t aware of it, many widely available scallions are allium fistulosum. The name Welsh onion is a misnomer in modern English and derives from the original Old English welisc or Old German welsche, meaning “foreign.” Both this crop and indigenous Britons were described as foreign, and as a result they share a name despite the fact that Welsh onion is Asian, likely originating from Siberia or China. It is known in French as ciboule and Portuguese as cebolinha and is an important ingredient in many Asian dishes.

      The large fruit of this handsome native tree has a custard-like consistency and delicious tropical flavor (something of a mix between banana, mango and coconut). Its seeds were likely dispersed by now-extinct North American megafauna (Barlow). Paw paw is the only member of the tropical custard-apple family that grows as far north as Michigan. It was cultivated by American Indians, as well as being an important food source for the Lewis and Clark expedition, and European settlers. Fans of asimina triloba have included Daniel Boone and Mark Twain. In modern times, powerful acetogenins in paw paw twigs have been recognized as a highly promising cancer-fighting compound.

      A native plum, it is known to make delicious preserves and also has a beautiful spring bloom. Its salt tolerance makes it an option for roadside locations. “Nana Beach Plum is a dwarf strain of beach plum developed by selecting five plants from over 4,000 seedlings that fruited one year from seed. We then began propagating them from seed to carry on the same dwarf traits. Fruit size is a little smaller than the species, but the productivity is much greater. Size is true to type from seed. Some plants fruit heavy when only 1 ft tall. Others fruit like a small column or are perfectly round in shape. After 20 years some plants are only 4 ft. tall. Another advantage is the plant doesn’t lean over with age. Even if you do not want the fruit the ornamental aspects of this plant will help you bring in the spring. Plant two for pollination and best fruit set. Height to 5 ft. or less. Hardiness -30 °F.” (Oikos)

It is easy to grow and rarely has few diseases or insects that affect production. Fruit ripening starts in late August. This is our common native plum found along streams and borders in woods from Connecticut to Manitoba to Florida. There is quite a bit of variation in fruit size and color.

      “This saskatoon cultivar is one of the oldest cultivars we have fruited at our farm. Originally from Bailey Nurseries in Minnesota, Regent has both high yields and good quality fruit. Regent is one of the best-tasting saskatoon varieties on our farm. Can be grown in a more confined area and fruits are easy to protect from birds. Dark blue fruit when fully ripe but can be harvested in the reddish purple stage if you want a tarter berry. Highly recommended for all wild food enthusiasts who also enjoy blueberries. The fruit can be used the same way. Saskatoons have ten times more vitamin C than blueberries. Dwarfish saskatoon variety to 6-10 ft. Some say this is another true saskatoon (alnifolia) selection but for us this species does runner a bit but not as much as Success. Zone 3. Hardiness -35 °F.” (Oikos)

      “In many respects, this black currant is very similar to the cultivated black currant of European origin. Long racemes of fragrant yellow flowers appear in April. The fruit ripens here in southern Michigan in early August. Even without processing, the fruit has a pleasant taste for a currant. Very high in iron and other minerals. The Native Americans took dried currants as a hunting food. Usually, this fruit is found in wetlands in the shade of other plants, but it can be cultivated with ease in any soil. Usually the crops are not large but last year with the hurricane rain, the branches were full of fruit. Our original seed source came from a wetland near Saginaw, Michigan found growing in pure shade. Immune to white pine blister rust. Two is better for this species to fruit. Light shade appears better for yields as well. Height to 3-4 ft. with equal spread. Hardiness -35 °F.” (Oikos)

In fact some people think this is just a larger version of it. Found throughout the midwest, a couple of varieties exist. Its best to have 2 plants for pollination. They appear to be self infertile. Leaves stay on throughout the summer and this species can really tolerate the heat well. Fruit size varies from 1/4 to 1/2 inch across. Its easy to grow this species in almost sand or clay soil.

      “Excellent flavored native gooseberry with 1/2" dark reddish-purple fruit. This species can grow and fruit heavily even in shade. We found this sub-species on a cliff overlooking the shores of Lake Superior in a beech maple forest. It seemed like the bushes were alive. Upon closer inspection, chipmunks were delicately climbing the thorny branches eating the fruit. It is best to process this fruit to remove the seeds and skins to make pie or jam. The quality of the fruit is good fresh but is a tad sour. This plant can grow in the open with minimal care and produces in 2-3 years from seedling. Best growth in an acidic sandy soil. Our ECOS selection is from the Western Upper Peninsula in Michigan selected for large fruit size. Seed grown. Comes true to type. Mulch with sawdust or hardwood chips.

      “The deeply cut, umbrella-like leaves of this common wildflower of woodlands grow to 12" across, and are carried on upright stalks 12 to 18" tall. This very tough plant spreads slowly to form a dense colony. It can make an excellent, handsome, long-lived, care-free groundcover, and is suitable for covering large areas. The leaves tend to go dormant in late summer, although dormancy is delayed if the plants do not lack for moisture. Mayapple thrives here in full sun, as long as the soil is moist, but it will tolerate drier soil and warmer climates better if it has some shade. The fruit, which looks like a small lemon and has a flavor reminiscent of tropical fruits, is edible when fully ripe in late summer. Fruit flavor is unusual, though agreeable, but the fruit is best eaten in small quantities. The fruit is a favorite food of box turtles and small rodents. Derivatives of Mayapple have shown promise in selectively killing cancer cells. All plant parts, except for ripe fruits, are poisonous if eaten. Exposure to sap can cause skin irritation in sensitive individuals.” (Tripple)

      This rich-tasting strawberry is also known as woodland strawberry (frais des bois). Unlike common garden strawberry, fragaria vesca is ever-bearing, meaning that it produces for the duration of the growing season. Archeological evidence suggests that the fruit was has been eaten by humans since the Stone Age (Wikipedia). There is also a white-fruited variety in the garden that sometimes produces fruit having pineapple-like flavor (fragaria vesca albicarpa).

      ”This native shrub bears large clusters of white flowers in early summer, followed by the edible berries. Elderberries are appreciated here as a fresh fruit eaten straight from the plant. They are also popular for use in making pies, preserves, and wine. The berries are also an important food source for many species of birds. The plants offered here are propagated from wild plants growing on the farm. While the fruit is smaller than that of some of the cultivated clones, we feel that the flavor is better. The plants should have a steady moisture supply, and preferably, good soil. Under favorable growing conditions, elderberry bushes will spread to form colonies. Because they can sometimes be unruly in appearance, elderberry bushes are best suited to informal landscapes. For fruit production, at least two should be planted” (Tripple)

      This is one of the most prolific chestnuts on our farm and reproduces true from seed. Our 20 year-old trees are now about 20 ft. tall and about 30 ft. wide. Some flowering and fruiting occurs in 3-4 year old trees but heavy yields begin after 5-10 years. Bright mahogany medium sized nuts fall free of the burr in mid to late October. Dense clusters of fruits are produced all along the branches. Our Ecos strain is more winter hardy than the species and has withstood –26 F without damage. Original selection came from a Michigan grower who obtained seeds from a research forester who was in South Korea over 50 years ago. Blight immune. Hardiness -25 °F.” (Oikos)

      “This native species is the most adaptable and reliable nut-bearing plant in North America. Immune to filbert blight and bud mite. Resistant to frost in full flower, even when the temperatures drop into the low 20’s. Shrubs are tap rooted at first, eventually producing stolons that turn it into a multi-stemmed shrub from 4-12 ft. tall. This is the most dwarf species of hazelnut. Starting in their 2nd year, small runners come out 3-6 inches from the main trunk. Each of these sprouts will begin producing nuts in two years after the catkins are formed. The nutshell is thick, but the flavor is outstanding. The Native Americans drank a tea from the inner bark to cure hives and hay fever. The nuts were crushed and used as a body for soup or eaten raw with honey. Good for pollinating other hazels. Can produce in light shade. Hardiness -35 °F. ECOS: A strain with a larger nut and a slightly thinner shell. Good productivity. This is a combination of Winkler seedlings and other native Michigan selections. All are excellent nut producers. The quantity of nuts produced often bends the branches to the ground. Good pollinators too.” (Oikos)

      “Precocious Hazelnuts combines a mixture of American and European hazelnut species to create a more disease and insect-immune seedling strain with high yields and larger nuts. In the process we found the flavor of “Precocious” nuts much superior to the cultivated “Barcelona”. It is due largely in part to the wild hazel background of these selections. Precocious was not a quick “create your own hybrid fix”. We stubbed our toe on this one more than once and it wasn’t until the ‘88 drought and a deep spring freeze that really eliminated our weak seed plants which in turn cleaned up our planting. That and “Dave” left for Texas. “Dave” went hazel crazy and then moved. With no care to over 20 acres of seedlings in southern Michigan, only a few made it through the storm. It’s from these few plants plus our seedlings grown from hazelberts and filazels from New York and Ontario, that we created the “Precocious” strain. Thank you “Dave”, but jeez come and visit once in a while. Filbert blight is a ruthless son of a. Fortunately the native hazels are rarely damaged and this is where we have concentrated our efforts. Our seed orchard represents selections made from over 20,000 individual plants. We still are vigilant on what we use for seed and now are in our 5th generation. In Turkey and other countries, hazelnuts are grown commercially in wild uncultivated settings with plants grown from seed from select plants. Two or more plants are planted in the same hole to make sure pollination is complete. Excellent as an under story plant in a woodland setting or as a hedgerow spaced 2-3ft. apart. Highest yields are obtained in full sun in slightly acidic soils-ph 5.5 to 6.5. “Precocious” can be used in wild as well as cultivated landscape settings. Yields begin in 2-4 years. 6-12 ft. height and width. Some plants may look like a lilac bush in shape and may reach 15 ft or more. Hardiness -30 °F.” (Oikos)
