Lemon balm should be avoided by anyone taking thyroid medication (thyroxine, for example), because it is thought to inhibit the absorption of the medication. This plant has been studied for its stress-reduction, antiviral and antibacterial properties. This species contains eugenol, which kills bacteria and has been known to calm muscles and numb tissues as well as terpenes that add to its soothing effects. (Wikipedia)"
